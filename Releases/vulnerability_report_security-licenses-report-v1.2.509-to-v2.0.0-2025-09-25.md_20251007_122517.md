|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| High | CWE-117 / Log Forging | frontend/Controllers/CheckoutController.cs:51 | Log entries created from user input. Building log entries from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to insertion of forged log entries by a malicious user. | Sanitize input before logging user data. |
| High | CWE-89 / SQL Injection | frontend/Controllers/LogInController.cs:17 | SQL query built from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to injection. | Use parameterized queries and validate/sanitize inputs. |
| High | CWE-1333, CWE-400, CWE-730 / Redos | frontend/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js:1394 | Inefficient regular expression may allow denial-of-service attacks. | Refactor regex to avoid catastrophic backtracking. |
| High | CWE-1333, CWE-400, CWE-730 / Redos | frontend/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/additional-methods.js:1092 | Inefficient regular expression may allow denial-of-service attacks. | Refactor regex to avoid catastrophic backtracking. |
| High | CWE-1333, CWE-400, CWE-730 / Redos | frontend/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/additional-methods.js:1092 | Inefficient regular expression may allow denial-of-service attacks. | Refactor regex to avoid catastrophic backtracking. |
| Medium | CWE-079, CWE-116 / Unsafe jQuery Plugin | frontend/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js:1047 | Potential XSS vulnerability in '$.fn.validate' and '$.fn.rules' plugins. | Sanitize all input, avoid dynamic HTML construction from untrusted data. |
| Medium | CWE-079, CWE-116 / Unsafe jQuery Plugin | frontend/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js:663 | Potential XSS vulnerability in '$.fn.validate' and '$.fn.rules' plugins. | Sanitize all input, avoid dynamic HTML construction from untrusted data. |
